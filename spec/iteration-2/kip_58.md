> Priv Validator Key Generation Tool

Create a standalone tool in golang that allows for generation of the Private Validator Key from 24 words mnemonic supplying as console parameter.

Tool must be fully standalone and output the same file as generated by `sekai` app when started.

> Example Output
```
{
  "address": "0E14B1A7219032970BC73A86E3B0DFAFD3F7182E",
  "pub_key": {
    "type": "tendermint/PubKeyEd25519",
    "value": "HagFv5Et0Foy/M8JOsUctt270s6knT0N5ioadIR71/c="
  },
  "priv_key": {
    "type": "tendermint/PrivKeyEd25519",
    "value": "aCdUY4qCNJo9zHXJ2Esb/rBVCo1cQczqHGP642jA7LodqAW/kS3QWjL8zwk6xRy23bvSzqSdPQ3mKhp0hHvX9w=="
  }
}
```

All fields and corresponding values must be present such as `address`, `pub_key` & `priv_key`. This tool is essential to enable generation and recovery of the validator keys.

Furthermore provide README which includes how to install, use and supply console commands such as mnemonic or output file path
