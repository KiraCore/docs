`KEX` is a native token of the Kira Network. By design Kira's native token is an inflationary utility token (created each block), but in the future might become capped (deflationary) depending on the future network consensus.

The base denomination of the `KEX` token is `ukex` (micro KEX) and equals `1^-6` KEX, or in other words `1 KEX` == `1'000'000 ukex`

The total initial supply or `KEX` tokens created in the genesis file will be equal to `300'000'000 KEX`. 

Initially all tokens will be credited into account of the `Kira Foundation` from where they will be distributed though the various off-chain and on-chain processes such as **interchain mining** aka [Initial Validator Offerings (IVO)](https://medium.com/kira-core/initial-delegator-offering-ido-b788c83c32d5). 

`Kira Foundation` is expected to permanently delegate **minimum** of `20%` of the total initial KEX token supply.
